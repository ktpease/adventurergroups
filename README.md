AdventurerGroups is a Web App and API for managing multi-user narratives (e.g. [tabletop role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game)), allowing user groups to each manage a collection of Characters and, optionally, present them in a public manner (either as a customizable website, through a web API, or through social media cards and images).
